        <p>The Grand Inquisitor is famed across Dorrelia for her sharp memory and unmatched mastery of speech.
            As guardian of the proper tongue, she commands both fear and respect in courtly circles.
            She gained power during the long debates of Nine Tongues, where her corrections silenced even the eldest lords.
            Legends speak of her quill breaking lesser wills â€” her notes said to be sharper than blades.
            Her lands lie in the heart of Dorrelia, where every student must speak true or be corrected.
