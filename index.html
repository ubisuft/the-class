      <h5>
        This is the Pact of Dorrelia, written and sealed by my hand, I, Margrave Ilia von Baltenheim,<br> 
        as a sacred contract of vassalage and mutual accord between the League of Noble Students and 
        the Grand Inquisitor of Incorrect Pronunciation,<br> dread guardian of the Spoken Word.
      </h5>
      <h4>My lords and comrades, we find ourselves in dire days.<br> The cutthroats of the South do rise in defiance,<br> 
        their tongues unbridled, their grammar accursed.
        <br> Discord spreads, foul utterances echo in the halls,<br> 
        and curses — spoken in haste by Lords and whispered in shrieks<><br> 
        — rend the harmony of our land.
      </h4>
    </div>
    <h2 class="titles">Let it be known that the noble lords of the League</h2>
    <h3>Duke-Diplomat Kourosh of Leydenia<br>Steward Negin de Bordeleux<br>Marshal Mehran van Helmia<br>and the Grand Inquisitor of Incorrect Pronunciation herself<br></h3>
    <h4>do hereby swear to stand as one, in peace, in loyalty,<br> and in wrath against all who speak ill and write worse.</h4>
    <p>So it is declared. So shall it be done.</p>
    <h1>the obligations of the league of students:</h1>
    <h5>On Taxes:</h5>
    <p>Each lord shall pay their fair share of tribute once every moon<br> (that is, once a month), so that the High Hall may have what it needs<br>  — warmth, light, and red pens.
    </p>
    <h5>On War and Defense:</h5>
    <p>When war comes, all lords must send their men,<br>  their strength, and their voices to defend Dorrelia<br>  from invaders — be they of foul grammar, poor spelling,<br>  or unclear speaking.
    </p>
    <h5>On Giving Lectures:</h5>
    <p>Every lord must speak before the Court of the Inquisitor<br>  at least three times during each chapter of study.<br>  Let their voices be heard, and may their thoughts<br>  be mostly finished.</p>
    <h5>On Heretical Speech:</h5>
    <p>The lords shall not use cursed speech too often,<br>  for it stains the tongue and confuses<br>  the ears.(the persian speech) 
    </p>
    <h5>On Dark Words:</h5>
    <p>Words of darkness shall not be spoken in sacred halls,<br>  lest the speaker be struck by awkward silence<br>  and teacherly glare.</p>
    <h5>On Speaking Too Long:</h5>
    <p>No lord shall speak longer than is proper.<br>  This law is especially for Kourosh of Leydenia,<br>  who hath forgotten what silence is.
    </p>
    <h5>On Council with the High Teacher:</h5>
    <p>When the High Teacher calls a council,<br>  the lords must attend, speak wisely.</p>
    <h5>On Destroying Evil Speech:    </h5>
    <p>If any demon of mispronunciation appears the lords<br>  must defeat it swiftly, with loud correction<br>  and possibly a dictionary.
    </p>
    <h5>On Fighting Amongst Themselves:    </h5>
    <p>No lord may start war with another lord unless<br>  the High Teacher allows it. If they do, the Inquisition<br>  will come, and it will not be merciful.
    </p>
    <h5>On Obeying the Grand Inquisitor:    </h5>
    <p>Any order given by the Grand Inquisitor<br>  that makes sense must be obeyed. If it doesn’t make<br>  sense, it must be obeyed anyway — but with<br>  a raised eyebrow</p>
    <h5>On the Law of Succession:    </h5>
    <p>Every lord shall obay the dorrelian succesion law,<br>  as it's the word of wises</p>
    <p>All lords agree to follow the rules of succession in Dorrelia,<br>  so that power passes fairly.    </p>
    <h1>The obligations of the grand inquisitor of mispronunciation:</h1>
    <h5>On rule of the teacher    </h5>
    <p>teacher shall rule in justice and peace,<br>  shall be just, honest and have traits of a virtue
    </p>
    <h5>On the overhearing sounds    </h5>
    <p>teacher shall not... show anger with "voice"<br> , as it darkens her soul and might<br>  damage the vassals ears
    </p>
    <h5>On time of war    </h5>
    <p>she shall order and rule over armies and vassals,<br>  think wisely and command
    </p>
    <h5>On importance of every vassal</h5>
    <p>every respected vassal must be treated with justice<br> 
        no difference among any, teacher<br>  herself is first among equals
        
        </p>
    <h5>On ownership of high penguin    </h5>
    <p>high penguin, in times<br>  if war can help in warm terrains,<br>  and be used by anyone in time of peace.
    </p>
    <h5>On the door of the hall    </h5>
    <p>the door of the high hall shall be<br>  closed when possible and opened rarely

    </p>
    <h5>On bordered vassals</h5>
    <p>the vassals in borders must resist and be<br>  protected by the grand inquisitor
    </p>
    <h5>On the decration of mortal obligations
        
    </h5>
    <p></p>
    <h1>Let it be known:    </h1>
    <p>All members of the League of Students,<br>  including the Lords, and the Grand Inquisitor,<br>  have read, understood, and agreed to these duties.

        This pact exists not only to improve our language,<br>  but to protect the learning environment, support each other’s<br>  growth, and make our lessons both useful and enjoyable.
        
        Let us speak with clarity.<br>  Let us learn with purpose. Let us never fear<br>  correcting each other — even when it hurts a littl</p>
